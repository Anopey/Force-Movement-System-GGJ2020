# Technical Features

### Custom 2D Physics System:

 The game features a custom 2D physics system, allowing for fine-tuning of character and enemy movement. This also allows for the setting up of customizable bounciness on the walls and enemies, and the sporadic push and pull caused by blood-flow.

### Custom Player Controller:

 The game has a custom player controller integrated with the aforementioned physics system to allow for fluid, force-based movement. This creates the feel of really swimming in a bloodstream.
 
### Additional Game Logic:

 The game logic includes: Enemy movement, enemy collider adjustment depending on animation, walls & bounciness, victory conditions, virus keystroke challenges, docking the ship, scene management, collision detection (Unity), HP, player distance from submarine after getting out, input, etc.
